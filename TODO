Features:
1.  Fine-grained ref locking, so you can safely run with autogc.
    Use namespaces to separate anchor refs from cloneable refs.
    Batch ref update into per-operation namespaces?
2.  Use shallow fetches
3.  Separate library for making a git repository chroot safe
4.  Smarter variant that keeps everything in the same git repo,
    with namespaces for each repository
5.  Remote variant that connects to a proxy daemon to take locks,
    request updates, query resolve-tree, ls-tree, cat-file, and
    clones from a git server served from the cache.
6.  Chainable variant

Bugfixes:

1.  If something tries to get_repo while it's being deleted,
    it will interpret the exclusive lock as it being set up,
    and assume it can use it after it gets the shared lock.
    It needs to detect that it was removed and retry.

Cleanup:
1.  Rationalise lock timeouts to config
2.  Define nice exception classes
